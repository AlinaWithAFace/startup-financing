Exploratory Note 7
The Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Statement of Cash Flows
```
## INTRODUCTION

Sound decision-making in an entrepreneurial context demands organized and timely financial data. Of
course, not all startup firms will be concerned with the same financial measures—firms with high-
growth potential, for instance, may be willing to sacrifice short- and medium-term profitability for long-
term value while firms with lesser opportunities are likely to be more myopic. For firms with outside
funding, the importance of financial statements increases even further as they constrain managerial
action, mitigate asymmetries, and establish a foundation for performance evaluation, among other
things. A general understanding of the basic financial statements, methods of analysis, and practice
when it comes to drafting them is a must for all entrepreneurs.

## THE INCOME STATEMENT AND BALANCE SHEET

To begin, we need to be particularly aware of the income statement (profit and loss statement) and the
balance sheet. These financial statements ought to be familiar to you from prior work in accounting and
finance, but a reminder is in order. An example income statement (both in dollars and common-sized):

What is the basic income statement equation?

How do you define cost of goods sold (COGS)?


What is depreciation? Does it matter?

A major benefit of debt relative to equity is highlighted in the income statement. What is it?

Is net income everything in business? Why might it be misleading?

And an example balance sheet (both in dollars and common-sized):

What is the basic balance sheet equation?

What are current assets? How are they organized?


What is liquidity and why is it important? How does it relate to the prior question?

What are fixed assets and why are they often important?

Are all successful companies heavy in fixed assets?

What are intangible fixed assets? Why do they matter?

What are current liabilities? How are they organized?

What is net working capital? Why does it matter?

What is the term for a firm that has negative shareholder’s equity? Can a firm operate if shareholder’s
equity is negative?

## THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS

The income statement and balance sheet are critical; however, they are stated on an accrual basis.
What does this mean?


In an entrepreneurial setting, why might accrual accounting lead practitioners astray?

In contrast, the statement of cash flows tracks the cash implications of transactions. For example, if
goods are sold now, with payment due in 60 days, the income statement will treat the revenue as
generated when the sale occurs, and the balance sheet will be immediately augmented by accounts
receivable, but the statement of cash flows will not show an increase in available cash until the bill is
paid. An example statement of cash flows:

Notice that the first entry is net income followed by adjustments for components of income which has
been recognized but for which cash has not yet changed hands.

Why is an increase in accounts receivable subtracted away?

What is a decrease in other current liabilities subtracted away?


Why is gross investment subtracted away?

Why are the proceeds from the issuance of new securities added back?

Especially for young startups that are burning money, the statement of cash flows (or a similarly
functioning burn model) is critical. In the end, no matter how good an idea may be, if cash only flows
out, success is unlikely to be realized.
