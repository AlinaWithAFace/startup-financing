Exploratory Note 13

Introduction to the Venture Capital Industry and its Participants

**INTRODUCTION**

Many entrepreneurs want venture capital; however, comparatively few are
familiar with the nuances of the VC industry and its participants. How
do venture capitalists think? What is their business model? How do they
operate? Are they abusive towards entrepreneurs? What else besides money
do they bring to the table? Certainly, not all venture capital firms
think and/or operate the same way, but as an asset class, there is much
that is generalizable. Tonight and next week, we explore VCs in quite a
bit of depth.

**VENTURE CAPITAL (VC) -- CHARACTERISTICS AND PARTICIPANTS**

A VC firm has five characteristics:

-   A VC is a financial intermediary, meaning that it takes investors'
    capital and invests it directly in portfolio companies.

-   A VC invests only in private companies. This means that once the
    investments are made, the companies cannot be immediately traded on
    a public exchange.

-   A VC takes an active role in monitoring and helping the companies in
    its portfolio.

-   A VC's primary goal is to maximize its financial return by exiting
    investments through a sale or an initial public offering (IPO).

-   A VC invests to fun the internal growth of companies.

Normally, a VC fund is organized as a limited partnership, with the
venture capitalist acting as the general partner (GP) of the fund and
the investors acting as the limited partners (LPs). Fund lives are
normally expected to be ten years, but can run longer.

Partnerships are interesting from a liability standpoint. What is the
level of liability exposure for the GP?

What is the level of liability exposure for LPs?

Who normally serve as GPs? What are their backgrounds? Do many careers
start in VC?

Who are the LPs?

**THE VC BUSINESS MODEL**

VC activities can be broken into three main groups: investing,
monitoring, and exiting.

***Investing***

Once a fund is successfully raised, investing begins with GPs
prospecting for new opportunities and does not end until a contract has
been signed.

What types of investments are going to be of interest to VC firms?
Consider a few tests that normally need to be passed:

-   Does the venture have a large and addressable market?

-   Does the current management have the capabilities to make this
    business work?

Why are these questions critical?

Is short-run profitability of concern?

***Monitoring***

Once an investment is made, the VC begins working with the company
through board meetings, recruiting, and regular advice to maximize
value.

Why is the board important?

Are VCs able to attract talent to startups?

***Exiting***

VCs are contractually obligated to return capital to their investors.
Accordingly, investment exit is a must.

IPOs are the most common. What is an IPO again?

What are the alternatives to IPOs?

Can this push for a liquidity event leave money on the table?

Are most portfolio companies going to be successes or failures from the
perspective of the VC fund?

**VC INVESTMENT STAGES, MAJOR INDUSTRIES SERVED, AND GEOGRAPHIC
PREVALENCE**

Major business model aside, VCs are also rather unique in their
investment focus when it comes to target stage, industry, and
geographical location.

***VC Investment by Stage***

VCs are normally thought of as very early-stage in focus; however,
investments are actually made across a fairly wide spectrum.

-   Seed/Startup Stage Financing

> This stage is a relatively small amount of capital provided to an
> inventor or entrepreneur to prove a concept. If the initial steps are
> successful, this may involve product development, market research,
> building a management team, and developing a business plan. This is a
> pre-marketing stage.

-   Early Stage Financing

> This stage provides financing to companies completing development
> where products are mostly in testing or pilot production. In some
> cases, products may have just been made commercially available.
> Companies may be in the process of organizing, or they may already be
> in business for three years or less. Usually such firms will have made
> market studies, assembled the key management, developed a business
> plan, and are ready to or have already started conducting business.
> This involves the first round of financing following startup, which
> includes an institutional venture capital fund. Seed and startup
> financing tend to involve angel investors more than institutional
> investors. The networking capabilities of the venture capitalists are
> used more here than in more advanced stages.

-   Expansion (Mid) Stage Financing

> This stage involves applying working capital to the initial expansion
> of a company. The company is now producing and shipping and has
> growing accounts receivable and inventories. It may or may not be
> showing a profit. Some of the uses of capital may include further
> plant expansion, marketing, or development of an improved product.
> More institutional investors are likely to be included along with
> initial investors from previous rounds. The VC's role in this stage
> involves a switch from a support role to a more strategic role.

-   Later Stage

> Capital in this stage is provided for companies that have reached a
> fairly stable growth rate---that is, companies that are not growing as
> fast as the rates attained in the expansion stages. Again, these
> companies may or may not be profitable, but are more likely to be
> profitable than in previous stages of development. Other financial
> characteristics of these companies include positive cash flow. This
> also includes companies considering IPOs.

***VC Investment by Industry***

Traditionally, VC investments have been concentrated in two broad
sectors: healthcare and information technology (IT), where the latter
sector is defined to include the communications, semiconductor,
software, and hardware industries. Why do these investments make sense?

***VC Investment by Region***

Since the beginnings of the industry, the Silicon Valley area of
northern California has remained the epicenter of VC activity, with a
consistent share of about one-third of total U.S. VC investments per
year.

What other geographic areas are notable? Why?

**VC INVESTMENT ROUNDS**

Institutional financing is provided in rounds, with the first being
referred to as a Series A, the second a Series B, etc. Why are staged
investments made?

Arguably, the staging of investment is a substitute for intensive
monitoring by the VC investor, especially when such monitoring would be
expensive. Why?

Staging also allows investors to learn more about the opportunity
(thereby reducing uncertainty) before escalating their commitment. Is
this logical?

Similarly, staging allows investors to constrain the actions of hold-up
entrepreneurs. What constitutes a hold-up entrepreneur and why are they
so dangerous for investors?

Looking at things differently, could staging provide bad incentives for
entrepreneurs to window dress results to get a new round?

**VC COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS AND ALIGNMENT OF INTERESTS**

VCs are compensated via management fees and carried interest.

***Management Fees***

VC investing is a long-run business, and investors must often wait many
years before enjoying any return of capital. Nevertheless, the expenses
of VC investing start immediately: salaries must be paid, the lights
must stay on, and due diligence must be performed. Thus, a baseline
management fee is necessary.

Typically, GPs charge a fixed fee of 100-200 basis points (1-2%) per
year. Sometimes, management fees drop after five years or so (since the
investments have largely been made by this point), but not always.

The lifetime management fees for GPs end up being fairly significant. At
200 basis points on 100 million in committed capital, for instance, a
total of twenty million will be paid over the ten year fund period.
Accordingly, the true investment capital of the firm is only 80 million
(total committed capital less lifetime management fees). A 25% lifetime
return (non-annualized) is required, therefore, simply to recover fees.

***Carried Interest***

The carried interest, or carry, is where the real money is to be made
for GPs as it is based on the fund's aggregate profits. For instance, if
a fund has 100 million in committed capital and exit proceeds amount to
200 million, then the total profit is 100 million. Commonly, GPs have a
20% claim on profits, so they will take 20 million, leaving 80 million
in profits to the LPs. The GPs with the best track records are able to
demand more---sometimes as much as 30%.

The timing when it comes to the taking of carried interest varies widely
across firms and can get pretty messy. Oftentimes, LPs are paid back
100% of investment capital before carried interest can be collected by
GPs. In other cases, LPs are paid back only the cost basis of all
realized investments plus management fees and write downs (on unrealized
partial losses) known to exist in the portfolio before carried interest
can be collected by GPs. Sometimes, minimum returns to LPs (usually
around 8-10%) on either committed or invested capital must be paid as
well before carried interest can be collected by GPs. In these latter
cases, carry claw backs become a possibility if high early fund returns
reverse over time.

Are there tax benefits to carried interest?

***Compensation and the Alignment of Interests***

Should the compensation structure of GPs align their interests with
those of their LPs?

LPs generally have restrictive covenants in place which constrain the
activities of GPs. For instance, GPs are almost never permitted to make
a disproportionately large investment in a single company. At first
glance, you might think that the concentration risk of a single very
large bet would be too much, but is this really what should matter for
LPs? If not, what would?

GPs essentially hold a call option on the value of the fund. Does higher
volatility imply higher or lower option values?

Are VC funds generally allowed to utilize debt? Why not? Again, thinking
about call options may be helpful.

Frequently, there are restrictions on coinvestment with earlier or later
funds by the same partnership. Why could this be a problem?

Similarly, these are often restrictions on personal GP coinvestment. Why
could this be a problem?

Does reputational risk help to keep GPs in line with their LPs?

Does the compensation structure of GPs seem to align their interests
with those of entrepreneurs?

**CONCLUSIONS**

This first note has introduced the basics of venture capital. In the two
notes which follow, we continue our discussion by evaluating the VC
value added (beyond just money) as well as the nature and historical
record of VC returns.
