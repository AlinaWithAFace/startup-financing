Exploratory Note 3
Risk Preferences, Rational Economic Man, and the Behavioral Alternative
```
## INTRODUCTION

In this second exploratory note of the evening, we shift our focus away from thinking about the sources
and discovery of entrepreneurial opportunities towards trying to understand the mindset(s) of those
who pursue them. Beginning with an overview of risk tolerance, the note proceeds to discuss the
assumption of rationality, and its implications, in the context of financial markets before laying out a
behavioral alternative rooted in the findings of psychology and sociology.

## RISK PREFERENCES

The history of rates of return on various asset classes, as well as numerous empirical studies, leaves no
doubt that risky investments command a risk premium in the marketplace. But, do all participants view
risk the same way? Probably not. Consider three possibilities:

**_Risk Averse_**

Risk averse market participants reject investment portfolios which are fair games or worse—they are
only willing to consider risk-free or speculative prospects with positive risk premia.

What is a fair game (in a mathematical sense)?

**_Risk Neutral_**

Risk neutral market participants judge risky prospects solely by their expected rates of return—the level
of risk is irrelevant meaning that there is no penalty for risk.

Does this match the mindset of anyone in this room? In all likelihood, it does—though you may not
realize it right now.

**_Risk Loving_**

Risk loving market participants are happy to engage in both fair games and gambles—they adjust
expected returns _upwards_ to take into account the “fun” of confronting the prospect’s risk.

Risk lovers may be described as reckless and rash, but they certainly exist in the world. Does this match
anyone’s mindset in this classroom?


Since entrepreneurs overwhelmingly fail in their endeavors (which more often than not represent their
primary, ill-diversified investment), are they necessarily more risk loving? Paradoxically, the answer to
this question seems to be no. Studies have shown that entrepreneurs are no more tolerant of risk than
other market participants.

## HOMO ECONOMICUS – RATIONAL ECONOMIC MAN AND THE IMPLICATIONS (IN FINANCE)

Interestingly enough, the core of mainstream economic theory has very little to say about different risk
tolerances. Why? Participants are assumed to be rational, self-interested, utility-maximizers—as such,
all are assumed to be risk-averse. In finance, this assumption, along with several others to be discussed
below, leads us to the efficient markets hypothesis (EMH)—an equilibrium condition which serves as a
major foundation for financial thought.

**_The Efficient Markets Hypothesis_**

Now, in order to understand the EMH, it is imperative that you understand what constitutes a perfectly
efficient financial market. What is a general definition?

What does this mean, on average, for market participants?

Does this hypothesis make intuitive sense? Which elements of the capital markets provide causal
mechanisms?

What role, if any, does competition play in the EMH?

**_Cherry-Picking the Empirical Record – Speculative Events (Or Bubbles)_**

The empirical record when it comes to the EMH is extensive and much of it is quite supportive; however,
there are some glaring issues—speculative events or bubbles chief among them. _Theoretically_ speaking,
what is a speculative event (or bubble)? Why do I include the word _theoretically_ in my previous
question?


In an efficient market, is it possible for speculative bubbles to appear?

What are some examples of historical (or current) market systems which could potentially be labeled

speculative bubbles?

_Roaring Twenties Stock Market of 1926- 9_

What can you tell me about the supposed speculative bubble of the mid- to late-1920s in the US equity
markets?

Consider the following table:

Describe the macroeconomic conditions over the summer leading up to the stock market crash in

October of 1929. What was going on outside of the equity markets?

Did the equity markets lead the economic collapse or did they follow? Is this normal?


In October and November of 1929, stocks in the US bottomed out and slowly recovered over the course
of the next decade. Is this statement true or false?

Is there a rational explanation for the behavior of stock prices during this period?

_The Conglomerate Boom of the 1960s_

What can you tell me about the conglomerate era of the 1960s?

Consider the chart on the following page to understand the mathematics underlying conglomerate
earnings growth:

In 1968, the conglomerates rapidly lost about 40% of their value across-the-board when Litton
Industries failed to achieve expected levels of earnings growth. There was a feeble recovery over the
coming years; however, conglomerates never again returned to such levels. Further, beginning in the
1980s, deconglomeration became the norm. Can anyone tell me about this?


_The Nifty Fifty of the 1970s_

Can anyone describe the nifty fifty to me? Why would investments in such stocks make sense to money
managers?

Consider the following figure:

Any rational explanation for this?

_The Japanese Asset Bubble_

What can you tell me about this?

Consider the following chart:


Any rational explanation for this?

_The US Dotcom Bubble of 1995- 2000_

We have chatted about this before, but the dotcom bubble is always worth another look. Consider the
chart on the following page:

Further:

Any rational explanation for what happened?


## THE BEHAVIORAL ALTERNATIVE

It seems fair to say that, at the very least, market participants sometimes act irrationally. This creates an
opening for an alternative framework such as behavioral finance. Leveraging the tools and insights of
psychology and sociology, behavioralist researchers have been making material contributions to our
understanding of finance for more than thirty years.

**_Biases_**

Excessive optimism –

Overconfidence –

Confirmation Bias –

Illusion of Control –

**_Heuristics_**

Representativeness –

Availability –

Anchoring and Adjustment –

Affect Heuristic –

**_Framing Effects_**

Attitudes toward Risk and Loss –


Aversion to a Sure Loss –

Narrow Framing Bias –

**_Impact on Corporate-Level Financial Decision-Making_**

So, how can these behavioral issues affect financial decision-making at the firm level? Let us consider
two particular areas: capital budgeting and mergers and acquisitions (M&A).

_Capital Budgeting_

What is capital budgeting? Traditionally, how are we supposed to go about handling capital budget
decision-making? Should emotions play a role? Do emotions play a role?

In reality, decision-makers frequently make capital budgeting decisions which “feel right”—oftentimes in
the absence of information of the presence of concerning information. An interesting example comes
from the experiences of Motorola and their multi-billion dollar flop, Iridium. Can anyone tell me about
Iridium?

Many capital budgeting mistakes come from excessive optimism. A study produced many decades ago
found that the military had historically made the following errors: missiles (4.9x in terms of actual costs
relative to forecasted costs), bombers (3.0), and fighter planes (1.7). This shouldn’t be too much of a
surprise given that governments seem to thrive on wasting money, but similar findings exist for the
private-sector. Studies have found, for instance, that nearly 50% of projects come in over budget. How
might decision-makers overcome these issues?

Decision-makers also have a heck of a time killing a project that is clearly dead to a rational mind. Sunk
costs are supposed to be ignored. Why is this?


What causes people to dig in and continue to plow money (called “escalation of commitment”) into
projects that just don’t make any sense at all? Does visibility matter? Regret?

_Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A)_

The mergers and acquisitions literature has yielded some very interesting findings. Among them, the
finding that decision-makers have a tendency to overpay when other firms are acquired is most striking.
It is referred to as the winner’s curse. Why might it happen?

An interesting case is the acquisition of Cerent Corp. by Cisco. Cisco ($225 billion market cap) offered
$6.9 billion in stock for Cerent. At the time, Cerent was pondering a modest $100 million IPO, had 300
employees, and had never turned a profit. In other words, it was essentially a start-up. A more recent
example would be Facebook’s $1 billion acquisition of Instagram (a year-and-a-half old firm with
thirteen employees) in 2012. Or its $3 billion _rejected_ offer for Snapchat not too long ago (at the time,
Snapchat was about a year old, had only a handful of employees, and had no revenue streams). Then
again, as time has gone on, this latter offer has appeared to be more reasonable as Snapchat’s successes
have begun to pile up.

**_Drawing Conclusions for the Entrepreneur_**

What can entrepreneurs learn from all of this?

## CONCLUSION

People are clearly different. We do not perceive all of the same opportunities. We certainly do not all
view risk the same way. It seems fair to suggest that we all, at least to some extent, suffer from biases,
have a penchant for relying on heuristics, and frame things in ways that are counterproductive.
Understanding our limitations allows for better decision-making—and this is critical for entrepreneurs.

## NEXT WEEK

When we meet next Tuesday, we will shift focus—though many of the issues raised tonight are likely to
come up again—to founders’ dilemmas, agency theory, and the matter of shareholder primacy.
