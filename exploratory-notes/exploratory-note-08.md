Exploratory Note 8
Financial Statement Analysis
```
**INTRODUCTION**

Financial statements are utilized not only by those who operate firms on a day-to-day basis, but by many
other stakeholders with an interest in a given firm’s activities including shareholders, commercial
lenders, and vendors. This second exploratory note of the evening is designed to introduce the basics of
financial statement analysis with a particular emphasis on ratio analysis.

**RATIO ANALYSIS**

By themselves, individual income statements, balance sheets, and statements of cash flow can only tell
us so much; however, given either a time-series and/or a benchmark, they can tell us a tremendous
amount—especially if we know how to calculate a few critical ratios:

**_Liquidity Ratios_**

What is liquidity all about again?

What does the current ratio tell us?


Why does the quick ratio have value? Why the adjustment for inventory?

Why does the cash ratio have value?

Is high liquidity always a good thing? Why might excessive liquidity be a problem?

**_Leverage Ratios_**

The debt-to-equity and total debt ratios give us a good idea as to debt level. What is the tradeoff
associated with debt?

When it comes to servicing debt, we have the times interest earned and cash coverage ratios. Why are
these ratios important?

**_Asset Utilization Ratios_**

What is inventory turnover all about? Is a higher turnover ratio better or worse? Is it always better or
worse?

How about days that sales are in receivables? Is a lower or higher number better? Are there
exceptions?


How about days COGS are in payables? Is a lower or higher number better? Are there exceptions?

**_Profitability Ratios_**

What is net profit margin? For an entrepreneur, is this necessarily the key profitability metric? Why
might net profit margin underestimate the short-term profitability of an entrepreneurial firm?

Why are ROA and ROE important? The higher the better?

**_Market Value Ratios_**

What is the price-earnings (PE) ratio? How can it be used for back of the envelope valuation purposes?

What is the price-sales ratio? How can it be used for back of the envelope valuation purposes?

## A CASE FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT ANALYSIS

The best way to understand financial ratios is to utilize them in a case setting. Consider the following:
XYZ Real Estate Management Company is in the business of buying and leasing properties and providing
facilities management services. Its financial statements from 2008 and 2009 are as follows (all numbers
are in millions):


## BALANCE SHEET

## 2008 2009

**Assets**
Current Assets^
Cash 300 120
A/R 900 670
Inventory 0 0
Total 1200 790
Fixed Assets
Net Plant and Equipment 3000 2300
Total Assets **4200 3090**

(^) **Liabilities and Equity**
Current Liabilities^
A/P 450 665
Notes Payable 750 1125
Total 1200 1790
Long-Term Debt 4000 4000
Equity
Common Stock and Paid-In 1000 1000
Retained Earnings -2000 -
Total -1000 -
Total Liabilities and Equity **4200 3090
INCOME STATEMENT
2008 2009**
Revenues 6000 4000
Costs 5000 5000
Depreciation 300 300
EBIT 700 -
Interest Paid 400 400
Taxable Income 300 -
Taxes (40%) 120 0
Net Income **180 -**


How much leverage is the firm using? Did its use of leverage increase or decrease between 2008 and
2009?

Is the firm in a position from which to successfully service its long-term debt (make interest payments
which are due)? Has this position strengthened or weakened between 2008 and 2009?

Is the firm in a position from which to successfully service its short-term creditors?

Is the firm profitable? What do its earnings look like?

What should the firm do to improve its prospects in the short-, medium-, and long-run?

## ANOTHER EXAMPLE CASE

ABC Box Company is in the business of forming and selling specialized corrugated boxes for the
agricultural industry. Its financial statements from 2008 and 2009 are as follows (all numbers are in
thousands):


## BALANCE SHEET

## 2008 2009

**Assets**
Current Assets^
Cash 200 400
A/R 500 300
Inventory 1000 900
Total 1700 1600
Fixed Assets
Net Plant and Equipment 750 680
Total Assets **2450 2280**

(^) **Liabilities and Equity**
Current Liabilities^
A/P 750 500
Notes Payable 50 50
Total 800 550
Long-Term Debt 100 100
Equity
Common Stock and Paid-In 100 100
Retained Earnings 1450 1530
Total 1550 1630
Total Liabilities and Equity **2450 2280**

## INCOME STATEMENT

## 2008 2009

```
Revenues 2000 1460
Costs 1600 1300
Depreciation 70 70
EBIT 330 90
Interest Paid 10 10
Taxable Income 320 80
Taxes (40%) 128 0
Net Income 192 80
```

Is ABC liquid? How has its liquidity changed over time?

Does ABC use a significant amount of debt?

Does the firm appear to be behaving in a conservative or an aggressive fashion?

What can we say about the firm’s revenues over time?

Is the firm profitable?

Are the firm’s prospects for the future good?

## CONCLUSIONS

Financial statement analysis is widely used, but it is by no means perfect. What are some of the critical
issues which financial statement analysis does not address? Why does this matter? Are there other
reasons to be concerned about it?
